# CloudRun
An Easy way to deploy app (alternative of GKE)

Cloud Run brings "serverless" development to containers and can be run either on your own Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters or on a fully managed PaaS solution provided by Cloud Run. You will be running the latter scenario in this lab.

# Core Steps

(1) create a Docker Image for App

(2) deploy/pull the container image to CloudRun

(3) update Website

(4) roll out new version of Website without Downtime (CI/CD)
